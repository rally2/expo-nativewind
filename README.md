## Main Components:

- Expo Router V2 via Expo Managed Workflow (Expo SDK 49)
- Nativewind (TailwindCSS for React Native)

This template does make certain opinionated decisions.  They are based on common project decisions I've come accross while building Expo apps in Production.


## 🚀 How to use

```sh
npx create-expo-app -e with-router
```
